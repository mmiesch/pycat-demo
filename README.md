Based on [this Medium article](https://aruva.medium.com/using-svelte-js-with-flask-backend-server-7f2c67dc11fe)

To install the Svelte server, run

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template client
cd client
npm install
```

Whenever you change anything in `client/src/`, run this to recompile svelte.  The results are put in `client/public`

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```
